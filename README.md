# Rate Engine 

Rate Engine is a machine learning Engine that helps to predict the transportation cost by some parameters.
Suppose Pennsylvania to Louisiana transportation cost depends on the valid miles, loads and vehicle type. Suppose SpaceX want to shift their rocket parts using truck so they can predict the cost of transportation and also get Idea about the which time is the perfect to send the goods from Pensylvennia to Louisiana
